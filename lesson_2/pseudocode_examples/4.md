* a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a
given character in a string. For instance, if the given character
is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6
(the index of the 3rd 'x').
If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return None. *

Casual


# given a string, given a target character #

set iterator to 1
set counter for target character to zero.

- iterate over each character in string
    - if character at space 'iterator' is target:
        add 1 to counter
    - if counter equals 3:
        - return iterator number
    - iterator + 1


    if counter is less than 3:
        - return None



Formal

START

# given a string, given a target character #

SET iterator = 1
SET counter for target character = 0

WHILE iterator <= length of string:
    IF character at string position 'iterator' = target:
        counter = counter + 1
    IF counter = 3:
        PRINT iterator

    iterator = iterator + 1

IF iterator < 3:
    PRINT NONE
