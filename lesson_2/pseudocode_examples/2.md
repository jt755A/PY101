# a function that takes a list of strings, and returns a string
# that is all those strings concatenated together

Casual

- Given a list of strings

- Iterate through the collection one-by-one
    - save the first string as a starting value
    - for each iteration, append the current value to the saved value
        - reassign the saved value as the concatenated value above

- After iterating through the collection, return the saved value


Formal

* Given a list of strings *

- iterator = 1
- SET saved_value = value at list index position 1

WHILE iterator <= length of list
    SET current_value = value at list position at space 'iterator'
    saved_value = saved_value + current_value

    iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT saved_value
