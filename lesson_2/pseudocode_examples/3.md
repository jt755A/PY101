# a function that takes a list of integers, and returns a new list with
# every other element from the original list, starting with the first element

Casual

# Given a list of integers

- initialize a new (blank) list
- set iterator to 1

- iterate through given list
    - for each iteration, append the value at iterator to new list
    - iterator + 2 

- After finishing iterating, return the value of the list.

Formal

START

# Given a list of integers called "integers"

SET output_list = a blank list
SET iterator = 1

WHILE iterator <= length of "integers"
    output_list = output list + value at space "iterator" in "integers"
    iterator = iterator + 2

PRINT output_list
