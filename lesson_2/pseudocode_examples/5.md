# a function that takes two lists of numbers and returns the result
# of merging the lists. The elements of the first list should become
# the elements at the even indexes of the returned list, while the elements
# of the second list should become the elements at the odd indexes.

merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) # => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]

# You may assume that both list arguments have the same number of elements.

Casual

# Given two lists of numbers

- create a new blank list
- set an iterator index to 1

- iterate over 2 lists sequentially
    - for each iteration, add the value of list 1 at "iterator" to new list
    - for each iteration, add the value of list 2 at "iterator" to new list

After iterating through both lists, return the new list

Formal

START

# Given two lists of numbers: "numbers1", "numbers2"

outputList = an empty list
iterator = 1

WHILE iterator <= length of "numbers1" # numbers2 has the same length
    outputList = outputList + value at "numbers1" 
    outputList = outputList + value at "numbers2"

    iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT outputList
