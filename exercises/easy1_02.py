# Print all odd numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive,
# with each number on a separate line.

# START
# SET iterator = 1
# WHILE iterator < 100
    # PRINT iterator
    # iterator = iterator + 2
# END

# counter = 1
# while counter < 100:
#     print(counter)
#     counter += 2

# SET range = 1-99, steps of 2
# FOR number in range
    # PRINT number


for number in range(1, 100, 2):
    print(number)


# Bonus Question: Can you solve the problem by iterating
# over just the odd numbers?

# see above
